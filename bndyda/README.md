For the latest pipeline, use bnpipeline.py instead of pipeline.py.

pipeline.py is being used in some AI solution projects (it's Bofu's memory, and it might be wrong. If we want to know 100%, we need Sherry's help confirm it).

But we will need to merge pipeline.py into bnpipeline.py and retire pipeline.py.
